MOTIVATION

Marvel Universe is a fictional universe created by Stan Lee and other artists since 1961. Throughout the years, more than eight-thousand characters have been built within this universe which consists of marvelous superhero teams such as the Avengers, the X-Men, S.H.I.E.L.D., etc. There are superheroes including Captain America, Spider-man, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Black Panther and many more. Those superheroes and superhero teams have gained worldwide popularity and become cultural icons via recent blockbuster film series (The Avengers), enabling Marvel to be a pioneer of transmedia storytelling in the modern media. Having huge respect for the creators and being fascinated with the characters and stories, we want to take this project as a chance to share our interest in Marvel Universe and apply social network analysis to visualize and understand the connections among superheroes.
